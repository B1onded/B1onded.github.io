Never will you be as fitted as a New Yorker,
who is never afraid to hop a turnstile and never tired enough in the morning to be a train performer.
Who looks at buttas and sees a lifestyle
and often remembers the NY streets based off the store on a corner.
Who understands exact change at the bodega will not make you wait awhile, 
and does not think about butter when reading the word "butter."
Never will you be as fitted as a New Yorker, 
but you can get close...
Never a true New Yorker, always a foreigner, 
but you love the timbs and the ock, and the Bacon, egg, and cheese, 
of course. So, insert a NY fit and follow the palette of color
and maybe you will become the next possible New Yorker.
